# Z80-MBC2_VGA32


## Z80-MBC2 Emulator running on TTGO ESP VGA32

This is a Z80-MBC2 emulator running on a TTGO ESP VGA32 board,
an ESP32 device with a VGA connector, PS/2 keyboard and mouse
connectors, an audio output jack and a Micro-SD card connector.

This emulator runs a Z-80 processor at ca. 5.7 MHz (without throttling).
The emulated Z80-MBC2 system is internally connected to the FABGL terminal,
emulating an extended color ANSI terminal.

It has a terminal configuration menu, accessible when the USER button is pressed
on boot. The configuration menu has the following options:
- `[D]isplay mode`: select the VGA resolution and color depth;
- `[K]eyboard layout`: select an international keyboard layout;
- `[T]ime settings`: automatic clock set-up on boot, via an Internet time server;
- `[W]i-Fi settings`: select a Wi-Fi network, used to set the clock.

The Z80-MBC2 configuration menu is also accessible using the USER button.
The menu has been modified from the real Z80-MBC2 system:
- `6: set Z80 clock speed`, changed to `6: Change user debug mode` - to invoke the simple
  debugger by pressing the USER button while the emulated Z80 is running;
- `9: change RTC time/date`, changed to `9: Change auto-boot mode` - to choose between
  always invoking this menu on start-up or only via the USER button.


## Build

To build this sketch, the following items are needed:
- Espressif ESP-32 hardware support tools and libraries for
  the Arduino IDE, either integrated using the "Additional
  Boards Manager URL":
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json>
  or by cloning the GitHub repo or downloading the ZIP from
  <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32> (be sure to 
  select the release branch "release/v1.0");
- FabGL library from Fabrizio Di Vittorio from GitHub:
  <https://github.com/fdivitto/FabGL.git> or my fork, which
  also contains support for the Belgian keyboard layout:
  <https://github.com/GmEsoft/FabGL.git>.

In Arduino IDE v1.8.x, in Tools - Board:, select the "ESP32 Dev Module"
board. In the configuration settings, select the following:
- Partition Scheme: "Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB APP with OTA/190KB SPIFFS)";
- PSRAM: "Disabled".


## Run

To start this emulator, get a FAT32-formatted Micro-SD card, copy all files from
the original Z80-MBC2 card image onto it, insert the card in the VGA32 module's
SD connector. Connect a VGA monitor to the VGA blue connector, a PS/2 keyboard
to the PS/2 purple connector, and an USB power supply to the Micro-USB connector.
